# 0x1D. C - Binary Trees

## Project Overview
This is a group project for the C programming language focusing on binary trees.

## Learning Objectives
After completing this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts without external assistance:

- What is a binary tree
- The difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree
- Potential time complexity gains compared to linked lists
- Understanding the depth, height, and size of a binary tree
- Different traversal methods for binary trees
- Characteristics of a complete, full, perfect, and balanced binary tree

## Header Files

- Prototypes of all functions should be in a header file named `binary_trees.h`
- Header files should be include guarded

## Data Structures

- Use the provided data structures for binary trees:
  - `binary_tree_t` for basic binary tree
  - `bst_t` for Binary Search Tree
  - `avl_t` for AVL Tree
  - `heap_t` for Max Binary Heap
- Note: Tasks 0 to 23 deal with simple binary trees, not following any BST rules

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Compilation on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc with options:       
  ```bash 
    Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
  ```
- Files should end with a new line
- A README.md file at the root is mandatory
- Code should follow the Betty style
- No global variables allowed
- No more than 5 functions per file
- Standard library usage is allowed
